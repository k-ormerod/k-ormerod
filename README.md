## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ”­

I'm Katherine Ormerod, a PhD student at the Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University. 

My research focuses on bright galaxies in the Epoch of Reionisation, the Universe's last major phase transition. I am particularly interested in the ionising properties of these galaxies, their dust content and properties, morphology, and how we can use these properties to determine their overall contribution to cosmic reionisation. 

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc by research at the University of Manchester, examining the size and structure of over 1000 galaxies with JWST NIRCam data at z>1.5. 

I am also interested in science communication and outreach, and have given talks in local high schools. 

As well as my interest in high-redshift astronomy, I also have a keen interest in football analytics, combining my experience as a football player with my interest in data analysis!
